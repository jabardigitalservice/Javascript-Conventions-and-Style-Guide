### 4.3 Line Length

**Short explanation:** 
In JavaScript code, there's no enforced maximum line length. However, a common convention is to limit lines to a specific number of characters, typically between 80 and 100.

**Why this number?** 

- **Readability:** That lines of code should be short enough to fit on a single screen without the need for horizontal scrolling, which can negatively impact readability
- **Maintainability:** Shorter lines are easier to understand, modify, and collaborate on. 

**Benefits of following this convention:**

- **Improved code clarity:** Everyone on the team can quickly grasp the logic without having to scroll horizontally.
- **Reduced errors:** Shorter lines are less prone to typos and accidental insertions.
